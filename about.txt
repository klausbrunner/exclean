ExClean is a skin for David Ekholm's excellent JAlbum photo gallery
generator. The goal is to have a clear, simple and friendly appearance
based on valid and modern structural markup. ExClean generates valid
XHTML and CSS, and adds support for navigation with the LINK
element. It is--quite intentionally--not as feature-packed as some
other skins, instead I've tried to get the details right. If you like
skins that don't clutter the screen with lots of stuff around the
pictures themselves, you might like this one.

Some of its non-obvious features, as found in some other skins:

* supports header/footer include files (header.html, footer.html)

* supports meta.properties files for each folder, making it
  possible to override these variables:

    title
    description
    parentIndexPage
    authorName
    allowIndexing
    fixedShape
    metaShowMode

Note that this skin currently lacks decent support for subfolders and
movies (it works, but it's ugly).
